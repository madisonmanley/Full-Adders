# Full-Adders

Includes all the code for up to 3-bit Full Adders by merging adders or logical units. Addition/Subtraction accuracy tests can be run in the same file, but reverse carry sum is separate.

Matrices are in pickle format.

Also included an excel sheet with the data I got during the summer, for reference.
